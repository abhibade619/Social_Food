## 2. The Problem
*   **Fragmented Discovery:** Food lovers rely on disjointed tools—Google Maps for location, Instagram for photos, and Notes apps for lists.
*   **Lack of Trust:** Generic reviews from strangers lack the personal trust of recommendations from friends.
*   **Social Disconnect:** Dining is inherently social, but existing food apps are solitary experiences.

## 3. The Solution
**FoodSocial** is the first social network dedicated to your culinary life. It bridges the gap between discovery and social connection.
*   **See** where your friends are eating in real-time.
*   **Track** your own journey with a digital food diary.
*   **Discover** new spots based on trusted social signals, not just algorithms.
